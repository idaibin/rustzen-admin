# ✍️ Git Commit Convention

This document defines the Git commit message convention for the `rustzen-admin` project. The goal is to improve log readability, enable automated CHANGELOG generation, and provide context for AI-assisted tools.

The convention is based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and is customized for this project with modular scopes.

## Subject

The `subject` is a brief description of the commit. Follow these rules:

- **Use imperative mood**: e.g., use `add` not `added` or `adds`.
- **Start with lowercase**: No need to capitalize the first word.
- **No ending period**: Do not end with a `.`
- **Be concise**: Recommended under 50 characters.

## ✅ Commit Examples

- **Feature**: `feat(user): add user role assignment logic`
- **Bug fix**: `fix(api): correct pagination query in user list`
- **Docs**: `docs(readme): update development startup instructions`
- **Style**: `style(ui): adjust table spacing and button size`
- **Refactor**: `refactor(auth): simplify jwt middleware injection`

## 🛡️ Linting & Enforcement

To ensure strict adherence to the commit convention, consider using these tools:

| Tool                   | Description                        | Node.js Required |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | :--------------: |
| `commitlint` + `husky` | Most common combo for frontend     |      ✅ Yes      |
| `lefthook`             | Rust-friendly cross-language hooks |      ❌ No       |
| CI check               | Add validation in GitHub Actions   |      ❌ No       |

These tools can automatically check every `git commit` message for compliance, ensuring high-quality logs from the start.
